I’m looking at you
I’m looking for you
I’m looking forward to it
You stay away from me!
Have you looked through that book?
Have you looked that book through?
Have you looked it through?
Dogs look up to us
Our financial situation is looking up
I always look new words up in the dictionary
I must be getting back
We started with soup and had ice-cream to end up with
All stories end up like that
She takes a lot of time to make up
He is ready to make up
They couldn't make up their minds what to do next
Do you give up?
His face took on a worried expression
Do you want to come in for a cup of tea?
Get out of here
He got out his glasses
He turned out to be a doctor
A statue was set up in his honour
A close friendship had grown up between them
She grew up in New York
He pointed out my mistakes
To go out into the country
Let's go out next Sunday
How did your chocolate cake come out?
When does their new album come out?
I must find out the train times
When are you going back to London?
